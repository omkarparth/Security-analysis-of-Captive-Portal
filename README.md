# Security-analysis-of-Captive-Portals
With the upsurge in open wireless networks at workplaces, hotels, coffee shops, etc., there is a need for a robust method to authenticate users. This is done by means of a captive portal, a web page that the user of a public-access network is obliged to view and interact with before access is granted. However, implementing a captive portal with its default confguration makes it vulnerable to many attacks. In this project, I performed a security analysis of a widely used captive portal, pfSense, by carrying out various attacks, proposing countermeasures and formulating the threat model. I showed that it is possible for an adversary to bypass the captive portal and gain unauthorized access to the network through DNS Tunneling, MAC spoofng, Dictionary attack, XSS (Cross site scripting) and SQLI (SQL Injection). I also proposed many countermeasures to mitigate the vulnerabilities in the captive portal, such as the closing of open ports, input sanitization, enabling encryption and slow hashing. It is through these experiments that I could expose the vulnerabilities of the pfSense captive portal and the countermeasures demonstrate techniques that can eliminate or extensively moderate the possibility of the aforementioned attacks.
